Problem Statement
--------------------

You are a database administrator. You want to use the data to answer a few
questions about your customers, especially about the sales and profit coming
from different states, money spent in marketing and various other factors such as
COGS, budget profit etc. You plan on using these insights to help find out which
items are being sold the most. Additionally you need help to generate some basic
datasets so your team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
You have been provided with the sample of the overall customer data due to
privacy issues. But you hope that these samples are enough for you to write fully
functioning SQL queries to help answer the questions

Load Excel Into SQL Server Table
---------------------------------

1. Create table in SQL Server that matches the structure of your csv file. Ensure that the table columns matches the column in CSV file.

-- Create Table Product
CREATE TABLE Product(
	ProductId int primary key,
	ProductType varchar(50) not null,
	Product varchar(50) not null,
	Type varchar(50) not null,
);

-- Create Table Location
CREATE TABLE Location(
	AreaCode int primary key,
	State varchar(50) not null,
	Market varchar(50) not null,
	MarketSize varchar(50) not null
);

-- Create Table Fact
CREATE TABLE Fact(
	Date date not null,
	ProductId int not null,
	Profit int not null,
	Sales int not null,
	Margin int not null,
	COGS int not null,
	TotalExpenses int not null,
	Marketing int not null,
	Inventory int not null,
	BudgetProfit int not null,
	BudgetCOGS int not null,
	BudgetMargin int not null,
	BudgetSales int not null,
	AreaCode int not null
);

2. Right click on database and select "Tasks --> Import Data"
3. Select source as "Flat File Source" and configure the delimeter and text qualifier string
4. Select destination as "SQL Server Native Client" and select the destination database and table
5. Start the import process.
6. Verify the count it should match with the csv count.

SELECT count(*) FROM Location -- 156
SELECT count(*) FROM Product -- 13
SELECT count(*) FROM Fact -- 4248

7. Woah ! We are done with the data loading.
